# Hi, I'm Moritz Resch

Welcome to my Github page!
I'm a former "Automation and Robotics" student at TU Wien and based in Vienna, Austria. This GitHub page showcases my work across various domains, including autonomous systems, robotics and some ML. Most of the projects are originally in private repos, but I hope to give you some insights on the projects I did in the past.

## 💼 Projects

### 📊 Master Thesis - Leveraging Large Language Models for Parametrization and Code Generation of Impedance Controllers in Robotic Manipulation
**Description:** Written at [GV LAB](https://www.gvlab.jp/contact-e.html) - Universtiy of Tokyo and [ACIN](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/) - TU Wien under supervision of Prof. Christian Ott and Prof. Gentiane Venture. In essence, the thesis tries to build a framework to leverage the world knowledge of LLMs to parameterize compliant controllers for dual arm manipulation tasks and autonomously generate trajectories.
A potential paper based on the thesis is still under review.
**Tech Stack:** Matlab, Simulink, Python

### 📊 Reinforcement Learning - Teach a quadruped how to walk
**Description:** In this project we (group of 4) implemented and trained a PPO based RL framework with reward functions from various papers to achieve locomotion on a 4-legged Unitree Go1 robot. A short paper provided in the repository gives insights on the implementation details.
**Tech Stack:** Python (gymnasium, mujoco, torch)

### 🌐 [Autonomous Racing](https://www.tuwien.at/inf/scuderia-segfault/)
**Description:** In a team of 5 we implemented the software for an autonomous (toy-) race car, which was equipped with almost 20k € of hardware, including Lidar, Nvidia Jetson Xavier, IMU, cameras, etc. The task was to autonomously race against other participating teams, where we ultimately used a mix of "Pure Pursuit" and "Disparity Extender" algorithms.
**Tech Stack:** Python, C++, Ros2, Docker

### 📱 [AREC - Austrian Real Estate Challenge TU Wien & Stanford University](https://www.tuwien.at/mwbw/im/ie/ifm/arec-austrian-real-estate-challenge) 
Also known as [ME310](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/global-engineering-design-inno)
**Description:** A 1 year project to learn how to approach a problem set by our industry partners, develope prototypes and finally come up with a working solution. This was done in a team consisting of students from the TU Wien and Stanford and included 2 stays at Stanford. Our final solution for the industry parnters was an automated HVAC system that adjusted heating ventilation and cooling depending on the demand and occupancy patterns whilst also measuring and presenting ESG KPIs, which were a new challenge at that time. 
**Tech Stack:** Python, C++, HTML, CAD
